This engineering thesis project, titled "A System for Transferring Digital Documents Using Near Field Communication (NFC)," explores the development of a secure and efficient system for transferring digital documents, including receipts and invoices, using NFC technology. The project encompasses a comprehensive analysis of existing literature on NFC technology, document storage methods, and security measures related to digital document handling.

The primary objectives of this project include:

Analyzing Literature: Conducting an in-depth review of relevant literature to establish a strong foundation of knowledge in NFC technology, document storage techniques, and security protocols.

NFC Communication: Investigating the potential of NFC for secure and rapid document transmission within close proximity, such as for business transactions, record-keeping, or data sharing.

Document Storage: Evaluating various methods of storing digital documents, with a focus on cloud-based solutions and mobile device storage.

Security Measures: Examining available security measures and protocols to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of transferred documents.

System Design: Designing a user-friendly and efficient system for document transfer and storage, leveraging NFC technology and cloud-based solutions.

Prototype Development: Creating a working prototype of the document transfer and storage system, demonstrating its practicality and functionality.

Testing and Evaluation: Conducting rigorous testing and evaluation to validate the system's performance, security, and usability.
